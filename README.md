# SampleApp experiment with rails

To get started with the app, clone the repo and installed the gems required:

```
> bundle install --without production
```
Next, migrate the database:
```
> rails db:migrate
```
Finally, run the test suite to verify everything working correctly.
```
rails test
```
If the test suite passes, run the rails server.
```
rails s
```
